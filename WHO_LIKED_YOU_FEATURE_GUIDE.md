# Who Liked You Feature - Production Implementation Guide

## 🚀 Feature Overview

The "Who Liked You" feature is a premium monetization tool that shows users who have already liked/super-liked them. This feature follows the successful pattern used by Tinder, Bumble, and other dating apps to drive premium subscriptions.

## 💰 Business Logic

### Plan-Based Access Control

| Plan | Access Level | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Drishti** (Free) | Blurred | Can see count and basic demographics, but profiles are blurred |
| **Sparsh** (₹399/month) | Blurred | Same as Drishti - still requires upgrade |
| **Sangam** (₹699/month) | **Full Access** | Can see all profile details and instantly match |
| **Samarpan** (₹1,299/month) | **Full Access** | Premium access with all features |

### Key Benefits
- **Instant Gratification**: Shows users who already liked them
