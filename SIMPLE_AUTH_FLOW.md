# Simple Auth Flow - What We've Implemented

## The Flow You Asked For ✅

1. **User signs up** → Collects only:
   - First name
   - Last name  
   - Email
   - Phone
   - Password

2. **Creates account** → Only stores:
   - Basic user info
   - Sets `onboarding_completed: true`
   - Sets `is_onboarded: true`

3. **Redirects to dashboard** → No verification, no onboarding, just straight to dashboard

## What We Removed

- ❌ Mobile OTP verification
- ❌ Email verification
- ❌ Onboarding flow
- ❌ Default profile values (gender, height, etc.)
- ❌ Complex field validations
- ❌ Profile scoring
- ❌ Premium features setup

## Files Simplified

- `app/signup/page.tsx` - Minimal signup
- `app/login/page.tsx` - Simple login
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - No onboarding checks
- `components/auth-dialog.tsx` - Simplified popup auth
- `components/signup-section.tsx` - Homepage signup simplified

## Testing

1. Sign up with any email/password
2. You'll go directly to dashboard
3. That's it!

## Notes

- Dashboard will show minimal content since profile is empty
- Users can fill out their profile later from dashboard settings
- No verification required for anything
