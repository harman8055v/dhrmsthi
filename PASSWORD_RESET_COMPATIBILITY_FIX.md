# Password Reset Compatibility Fix

## Issue
The new authentication middleware was interfering with the password reset flow by:
1. Running `getSession()` on the `/reset-password` route
2. Potentially causing session refresh conflicts during the reset process

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated Middleware** (`middleware.ts`)
- Added explicit exclusion for auth-related routes:
  - `/reset-password`
  - `/login`
  - `/auth-loading`
  - `/email-confirmed`
- These routes now bypass middleware completely to handle their own auth state

### 2. **Updated Matcher Configuration**
- Added auth routes to the matcher exclusion pattern
- Prevents middleware from running on these routes at all

### 3. **Preserved PASSWORD_RECOVERY Handling**
- Confirmed that `useAuth` hook still ignores PASSWORD_RECOVERY events
- This maintains compatibility with the password reset flow as documented

## Key Points

1. **No Changes to ResetPasswordClient.tsx**
   - The password reset component remains untouched
   - Still uses the proven "fire and forget" approach
   - Still detects `?code=` parameter as expected

2. **Auth Hook Compatibility**
   - Still ignores PASSWORD_RECOVERY events
   - Won't interfere with reset page's own session handling

3. **Middleware Exclusion**
   - Reset password route completely bypasses middleware
   - No session refresh interference
   - No authentication checks on reset flow

## Testing Password Reset

The password reset flow should work exactly as documented in `PASSWORD_RESET_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`:

1. User requests reset → receives email with `?code=xxx` link
2. Clicks link → Supabase creates session automatically
3. Reset page detects code → shows password form
4. User submits new password → fire-and-forget update
5. Success message → redirect to homepage

## Verification

Run these console commands to verify:
```javascript
// On reset page with ?code= parameter, should see:
// [ResetPassword] Checking for password reset code...
// [ResetPassword] URL params: { code: true, errorDesc: undefined }
// [ResetPassword] Password reset code detected!
```

The middleware will NOT run on `/reset-password`, ensuring no interference with the carefully tested password reset implementation.
