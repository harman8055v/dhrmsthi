# Password Reset Complete Fix

## The Problem
When clicking password reset link:
1. Supabase creates a session (as designed)
2. Our auth system detected the session and redirected to dashboard
3. User couldn't complete password reset

## The Solution

### 1. **Auth Hook** (`hooks/use-auth.ts`)
- Skip all auth processing when on `/reset-password` page
- Prevents profile fetching and state updates during reset

### 2. **Login Page** (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)
- Check if coming from password reset
- Don't auto-redirect to dashboard in that case
- Uses sessionStorage flag to detect reset flow

### 3. **Password Reset** (`app/(auth)/reset-password/ResetPasswordClient.tsx`)
- Sign out the reset session after password update
- Set sessionStorage flag before redirecting to login
- Maintains the "fire and forget" approach

### 4. **Supabase Client** (`lib/supabase.ts`)
- Uses standard `createClient` instead of auth helpers
- Prevents middleware interference

### 5. **Native Bridge** (`components/native-bridge-enhanced.tsx`)
- Skip auth monitoring on password reset pages
- Ignore PASSWORD_RECOVERY events

### 6. **Middleware** (`middleware.ts`)
- Temporarily disabled to prevent interference

## Flow Now Works As:
1. User clicks reset link → Supabase creates session
2. Auth system ignores this session on reset page
3. User enters new password → Fire and forget update
4. Sign out the reset session
5. Redirect to login with flag
6. Login page sees flag and doesn't auto-redirect
7. User can log in with new password

## Key Insight
The password reset creates a temporary session that should be ignored by the auth system until the reset is complete.
