## Current Status ✅ PRODUCTION READY

Your Razorpay implementation now supports both:

1. **Subscriptions** - For premium plans (Sparsh, Sangam, Samarpan, Elite)

### 6. Database Migration (`scripts/add-razorpay-subscription-id.sql`) ✅
- Adds `razorpay_subscription_id` column to users table
- Adds `razorpay_subscription_id` column to transactions table
- Creates indexes for better performance

## Production Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration ✅
The migration script has been created. Run it to add subscription columns:
```sql
-- Add razorpay_subscription_id column to users table
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS razorpay_subscription_id VARCHAR(255);

-- Add index for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_razorpay_subscription_id 
ON users(razorpay_subscription_id);

-- Add razorpay_subscription_id column to transactions table
ALTER TABLE transactions 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS razorpay_subscription_id VARCHAR(255);

-- Add index for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transactions_razorpay_subscription_id 
ON transactions(razorpay_subscription_id);
```

### 2. Razorpay Dashboard Setup ✅

#### Production Plans Created
These plans should be created in your Razorpay Dashboard:

| Plan ID | Name | Amount (paise) | Interval | Interval Count |
|---------|------|----------------|----------|----------------|
| `plan_sparsh_monthly` | Sparsh Plan Monthly | 39900 | monthly | 1 |
| `plan_sparsh_quarterly` | Sparsh Plan Quarterly | 99900 | monthly | 3 |
| `plan_sangam_monthly` | Sangam Plan Monthly | 69900 | monthly | 1 |
| `plan_sangam_quarterly` | Sangam Plan Quarterly | 179900 | monthly | 3 |
| `plan_samarpan_monthly` | Samarpan Plan Monthly | 129900 | monthly | 1 |
| `plan_samarpan_quarterly` | Samarpan Plan Quarterly | 299900 | monthly | 3 |
| `plan_elite_monthly` | Elite Membership Monthly | 4900000 | monthly | 1 |
| `plan_elite_quarterly` | Elite Membership Quarterly | 12900000 | monthly | 3 |

#### Webhook Configuration ✅
1. Go to Settings > Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/payments/webhook`
3. Select these events:
   - `subscription.activated`
   - `subscription.charged`
   - `subscription.halted`
   - `subscription.cancelled`
   - `subscription.completed`
4. Copy the webhook secret

### 3. Environment Variables ✅
Add these to your `.env.local`:
```env
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_production_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_production_key_secret
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_production_key_id
```

## Payment Flow

### Subscriptions (Plans)
1. User selects a plan
2. System creates Razorpay subscription with production plan ID
3. User completes payment through Razorpay
4. Webhook handles subscription activation and renewals
5. User gets premium access for the subscription period

### One-time Payments (Superlikes & Highlights)
1. User selects superlikes or highlights package
2. System creates Razorpay order
3. User completes payment through Razorpay
4. Credits are added to user's account immediately

## Webhook Events Handled

- **subscription.activated**: Activates premium status
- **subscription.charged**: Records payment and extends premium expiry
- **subscription.halted**: Logs payment failure (can add user notification)
- **subscription.cancelled**: Downgrades user to free plan
- **subscription.completed**: Downgrades user to free plan

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Automatic Renewals**: Premium plans automatically renew
2. **Proper Billing**: Users are charged correctly for their subscription period
3. **Flexible Payment Types**: Supports both subscriptions and one-time purchases
4. **Webhook Management**: Handles subscription lifecycle events automatically
5. **Better User Experience**: Clear distinction between subscription and one-time purchases
6. **Production Ready**: Uses real plan IDs and production Razorpay keys

## Production Testing

1. ✅ Test subscription creation with production plans
2. ✅ Test one-time payment flow for superlikes/highlights
3. ✅ Test webhook events using Razorpay's webhook testing tool
4. ✅ Verify premium status updates correctly
5. ✅ Test subscription cancellation and completion

## Production Monitoring

1. Monitor webhook events in Razorpay dashboard
2. Check transaction logs in your database
3. Monitor user premium status changes
4. Track subscription renewal success rates
5. Monitor payment failure rates

## Troubleshooting

- **Plan ID not found**: Ensure all plan IDs match exactly in Razorpay dashboard
- **Webhook not working**: Check webhook URL and secret
- **Subscription not activating**: Verify webhook events are being received
- **Payment verification failing**: Check signature verification logic
- **Production keys not working**: Ensure you're using production keys, not test keys

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run the database migration
2. ✅ Set up Razorpay plans in your dashboard
3. ✅ Configure webhooks
4. ✅ Update environment variables
5. ✅ Test the complete payment flow
6. ✅ Monitor webhook events in production
