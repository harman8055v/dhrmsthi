# DharmaSaathi Referral System - Production Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Overview

The referral system is now **production-ready** and fully integrated into DharmaSaathi. This system tracks when users sign up with referral codes and rewards users for successful referrals.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Complete Signup Flow Integration**
- ✅ URL parameter capture (`?ref=REFERRALCODE`)
- ✅ Database integration during user registration
- ✅ API endpoint for referral processing
- ✅ Error handling and logging

### 2. **Database Architecture**
- ✅ `referrals` table for tracking referral relationships
- ✅ `referral_rewards` table for managing rewards
- ✅ Database functions for processing referrals
- ✅ Triggers for automatic reward allocation
- ✅ Analytics view for reporting

### 3. **Reward System**
- ✅ **4 referrals**: Fast-track verification
- ✅ **10 referrals**: 30-day Sangam plan
- ✅ **20 referrals**: 45-day Samarpan plan
- ✅ Automatic reward activation when users get verified

### 4. **Frontend Integration**
- ✅ Referral program dashboard
- ✅ Link generation and sharing
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ New user welcome with referral encouragement

## 🛠 Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup
Run the production setup script in your Supabase/PostgreSQL database:

```sql
-- Run this script in your production database
\i scripts/setup-production-referral-system.sql
```

**What it does:**
- Creates all necessary tables and indexes
- Sets up database functions and triggers
- Generates referral codes for existing users
- Creates analytics views
- Validates the setup

### Step 2: Verify Database Setup
Run the test script to ensure everything works:

```sql
-- Test the referral system
\i scripts/test-referral-system.sql
```

Expected output should show all ✓ (checkmarks).

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Ensure your production environment has proper Supabase configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Step 4: Deploy Code Changes
The following files have been updated and need to be deployed:

- `components/signup-section.tsx` - Captures referral codes
- `app/api/referrals/signup/route.ts` - New API endpoint
- `components/dashboard/referral-program.tsx` - Enhanced UI
- `components/dashboard/new-user-welcome.tsx` - Referral encouragement

## 📊 How It Works

### User Signup with Referral
1. User visits: `https://dharmasaathi.com/signup?ref=ABC12345`
2. Signup form captures the `ref` parameter
3. After successful registration, system calls `/api/referrals/signup`
4. Database function `handle_referral_signup()` creates referral record
5. Referrer's `total_referrals` count increases

### Reward Activation
1. When referred user gets **verified** (verification_status = 'verified')
2. Database trigger `referral_completion_trigger` fires
3. Referral status changes from 'pending' to 'completed'
4. Referrer's `referral_count` (successful referrals) increases
5. Rewards automatically awarded based on milestones:
   - 4+ referrals → Fast-track verification
   - 10+ referrals → 30-day Sangam plan
   - 20+ referrals → 45-day Samarpan plan

## 🔍 Testing the System

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Signup Flow**
   - [ ] Visit `/signup?ref=TESTCODE`
   - [ ] Complete registration
   - [ ] Check database for referral record
   
2. **Reward Activation**
   - [ ] Change referred user to verified status
   - [ ] Check if referral status becomes 'completed'
   - [ ] Verify referrer's count increases
   - [ ] Check if rewards are awarded at milestones

3. **Dashboard Display**
   - [ ] Login as user with referrals
   - [ ] Check referral program shows correct stats
   - [ ] Verify referral links work
   - [ ] Test sharing functionality

### Database Queries for Verification

```sql
-- Check referral records
SELECT * FROM referrals ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check rewards
SELECT * FROM referral_rewards ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Analytics overview
SELECT * FROM referral_analytics;

-- User referral stats
SELECT id, first_name, email, referral_code, total_referrals, referral_count 
FROM users 
WHERE total_referrals > 0 
ORDER BY referral_count DESC;
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Conversion Rate**: Signups with referral codes vs total signups
2. **Verification Rate**: Referred users who complete verification
3. **Top Referrers**: Users with most successful referrals
4. **Reward Distribution**: How many users reach each milestone

### SQL Queries for Analytics

```sql
-- Daily referral signups
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as referral_signups
FROM referrals 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Conversion funnel
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_referrals,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as verified_referrals,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END)::NUMERIC / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as conversion_rate
FROM referrals;

-- Reward distribution
SELECT 
  reward_type,
  COUNT(*) as users_with_reward,
  AVG(referrals_required) as avg_referrals_needed
FROM referral_rewards 
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY reward_type;
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Database Permissions
The setup script grants necessary permissions to the `authenticated` role. Ensure your Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies allow:
- Users to read their own referral data
- API to create referral records
- Triggers to update user statistics

### Performance Considerations
- All tables have proper indexes for fast queries
- Database functions are optimized for production load
- Referral codes are unique and efficiently generated

### Security
- Referral codes are randomly generated (8 characters)
- No sensitive data exposed in referral links
- API endpoints validate input parameters
- Database functions prevent duplicate referrals

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Referral not recorded**
   - Check if `handle_referral_signup` function exists
   - Verify API endpoint is accessible
   - Check console logs for errors

2. **Rewards not awarded**
   - Ensure trigger `referral_completion_trigger` exists
   - Check if user verification status changed to 'verified'
   - Verify reward conditions in trigger function

3. **Statistics not updating**
   - Check if trigger fired (look for NOTICE logs)
   - Verify database functions have correct permissions
   - Manual recount: Run production setup script again

### Debug Queries

```sql
-- Check if functions exist
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name IN ('handle_referral_signup', 'process_referral_completion');

-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'referral_completion_trigger';

-- Test referral function manually
SELECT handle_referral_signup('user_id_here', 'REFERRAL_CODE_HERE');
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: Run the setup script in production database
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Use test script and manual testing
3. **Monitor Metrics**: Set up analytics dashboard
4. **User Communication**: Announce referral program to users
5. **Optimize**: Based on usage patterns and feedback
