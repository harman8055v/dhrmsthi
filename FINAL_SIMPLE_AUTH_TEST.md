# Testing the Simplified Auth Flow

## What Should Happen Now:

1. **Homepage Signup**:
   - Fill out the form (First name, Last name, Email, Phone, Password)
   - Click "Create Account"
   - You should go DIRECTLY to `/dashboard` (NOT to `/onboarding`)

2. **Dashboard**:
   - You should see the dashboard immediately
   - No onboarding checks
   - No redirects

## Files We Fixed:

✅ **Removed ALL onboarding redirects from:**
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Main dashboard
- `components/dashboard/home-view.tsx` - Home view component
- `app/dashboard/matches/page.tsx` - Matches page
- `app/dashboard/messages/page.tsx` - Messages page  
- `app/dashboard/store/page.tsx` - Store page
- `components/auth-loading-screen.tsx` - Auth loading screen

✅ **Simplified signup in:**
- `app/signup/page.tsx` - Standalone signup
- `components/signup-section.tsx` - Homepage signup form
- `components/auth-dialog.tsx` - Modal auth

## Test Now:

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Use the homepage signup form
3. Create an account
4. You should land on `/dashboard` immediately

## If Still Redirecting to Onboarding:

Run this command to find any remaining redirects:
```bash
grep -r "router.push.*onboarding" app/ components/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
```
