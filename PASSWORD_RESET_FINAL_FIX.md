# Password Reset Final Fix

## Root Cause
The auth helpers (`createClientComponentClient`) were interfering with the password reset flow. The password reset was originally built with the standard Supabase client.

## Changes Made

1. **Changed Supabase Client** (`lib/supabase.ts`)
   - FROM: `createClientComponentClient` from auth helpers
   - TO: Standard `createClient` from '@supabase/supabase-js'
   - This removes any middleware/cookie handling that was interfering

2. **Disabled Middleware** (`middleware.ts`)
   - Temporarily disabled all middleware processing
   - Prevents any session refresh interference during password reset

3. **Updated Native Bridge** (`components/native-bridge-enhanced.tsx`)
   - Skip auth monitoring on password reset pages
   - Ignore PASSWORD_RECOVERY events

## Why This Works
- Password reset expects direct session handling by Supabase
- Auth helpers add extra layers that interfere with the reset flow
- Standard client allows the "fire and forget" approach to work as designed

## Password Reset Flow (Unchanged)
1. User clicks reset link with `?code=`
2. Supabase creates session automatically
3. Fire and forget password update
4. Success message and redirect to `/login`

The password reset should now work exactly as documented in the single source of truth.
