# Password Reset Fix Summary

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. **Simplified ResetPasswordClient.tsx**
- Removed overcomplicated auth checking logic
- Now follows the simple pattern from Supabase documentation
- Only listens for `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` event
- Added console logging for debugging

### 2. **Fixed Redirect URL in auth-dialog.tsx**
- Changed from `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/reset-password`
- To hardcoded: `https://dharmasaathi.com/reset-password`
- This ensures consistency with Supabase configuration

## üéØ How It Works Now

1. User requests password reset via `auth-dialog.tsx`
2. Email is sent with link to `/reset-password`
3. When user clicks link, Supabase processes it and fires `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` event
4. Component shows password reset form
5. User submits new password
6. Password is updated and user is redirected to homepage

## ‚úÖ Testing Steps

1. **Request Password Reset**
   ```bash
   # Go to login dialog and click "Forgot Password?"
   # Enter your email
   ```

2. **Check Email**
   - Look for email from DharmaSaathi
   - Click the reset password link

3. **Verify Behavior**
   - Should briefly show "Verifying password reset link..."
   - Then show the password reset form
   - Enter new password and confirm
   - Should show success message and redirect

## üêõ Debugging

If still experiencing issues, check browser console for logs:
- `[ResetPassword] Component mounted...`
- `[ResetPassword] Auth event: PASSWORD_RECOVERY`
- `[ResetPassword] PASSWORD_RECOVERY event received!`

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Supabase Configuration Required**:
   - Ensure `https://dharmasaathi.com/reset-password` is in allowed redirect URLs
   - Email template must use `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`

2. **Local Development**:
   - Add `http://localhost:3000/reset-password` to redirect URLs
   - May need to test with production URL due to redirect restrictions

3. **DO NOT OVERCOMPLICATE** - The implementation follows Supabase docs exactly

## üö® Common Issues

1. **Infinite Loading**: Fixed by simplifying auth check logic
2. **No PASSWORD_RECOVERY Event**: Fixed by ensuring useAuth hook ignores this event
3. **Wrong Redirect URL**: Fixed by using hardcoded production URL

The password reset should now work correctly! üéâ
